  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> In recent years, I started to befriend with someone that was in my friend's group. In this research, the strength and buckling behavior analysis of a lollipop security model shell for the sightseeing submersible subjected to a graph signal of my appreciation for him are studied.</p>
  <p>
     Based on the Stenbergâ€™s triangular theory, the governing equations of strength analysis for the lollipop shell are established, and the domains are being solved used an implementation of the Classical Fourier transform, provided to represent the frequency domain representation of the signals.
Alongside the improvement of something else socially and eco-cognizant creation and promoting
rehearses, such as the usage of dopamine, cortisol, serotonin, and ocxytocin.
